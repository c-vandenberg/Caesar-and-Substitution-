# Caesar-and-Substitution-
The first file is a Caesar cipher, one of the simplest encryption techniques, whereby each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, one of the most well known is the ROT13 Caesar cipher where each letter is replaced by the 13th letter after it.

The second, while not what you'd want to encrypt your WhatsApp messages, gives a slightly more complex ciphertext. It allows the user to input a 24 letter long mixed alphabet key of their choosing, and the plaintext will be encrypted according to this fixed key.
